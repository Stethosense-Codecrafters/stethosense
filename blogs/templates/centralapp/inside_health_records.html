                <p>
                    An health record or an <strong>electronic health record (EHR)</strong>, as it is commonly called, is a <strong>digital version</strong> of a patient’s paper chart. <br>
                    EHRs are real-time, patient-centered records that make information available instantly and securely to authorized users.<br>
                    While an EHR does contain the medical and treatment histories of patients, it is built to go beyond standard clinical data collected in a doctor’s office and can be inclusive of a broader view of a patient’s care. EHRs are a vital part of health IT and can:
                <ul>
                <li>Contain a patient’s medical history, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, and laboratory and test results</li>
                <li>Allow access to evidence-based tools that providers can use to make decisions about a patient’s care</li>
                <li>Automate and streamline provider workflow</li></ul>

                One of the key features of an EHR is that health information can be created and managed by authorized providers <strong>in a digital format capable of being shared with other doctors</strong> across more than one health care organization. EHRs are built to share information with other health care providers and organizations – such as laboratories, specialists, medical imaging facilities, pharmacies, emergency facilities, and school and workplace clinics – thus <strong>eliminating the need to maintain paperwork.</strong>
